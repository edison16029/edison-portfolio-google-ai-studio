# My Solo Travel Tips

Traveling alone for the first time is one of the most liberating experiences you can have. It forces you to engage with the world on your own terms.

## Preparation is Key

Before you go, make sure you've mapped out your "first day" strategy. The moment you land is the most vulnerable you'll be.

### 1. The Offline Map
Always download the Google Maps area for your destination. You can't always rely on roaming or local SIMs immediately.

### 2. Local Etiquette
Learn at least five phrases:
- Hello
- Thank you
- Please
- Where is the bathroom?
- Do you speak English?

### 3. The Power of Choice
The best part about solo travel? You don't have to wait for anyone. If you want to spend 4 hours in a museum, do it. If you want to skip it for a cafe, do it.

## Conclusion

Travel is about curiosity. Don't check boxes. Experience the unknown.
