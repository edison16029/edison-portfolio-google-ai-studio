After considering atleast 5 other places including Maldives, Bali and Netherlands, me and my wife finally landed on picking Thailand as our honeymoon destination. Both of us love relaxing trips and we felt the beaches of Thailand suited the best for we were looking for. We made the trip during the last week of October, as that is when the rains start to dry out and transition into a more tourist friendly weather.  

## Itinerary

Our strategy was quite straight-forward. We wanted one week trip, covering as many places as possible at a relaxed pace. So we decided to visit the 3 big cities/provinces - Phuket, Krabi & Bangkok. One major miss out was Chiang Mai - the northern province with lots of nature and greenery. We couldn't quite fit it in the itinerary and considering we were more keen on enjoying in the beaches more, we didn't want to swap out Phuket or Krabi. Another thing we intentionally skipped was Pattaya, as neither of us were too keen on partying.

### Preparation
Since this was our first internation trip together, both of us were really really over-prepared for the trip, trying to compensate for the lack of experience. We made all the ticket and hotel booking from home, made multiple copies of the ticket and spread them across each luggage along with our ID proofs. We exchanged Rs. 1 Lakh to Thai Bhat also before the trip. We packed more than 8 days worth of clothes. Like I said, we were really prepared.

### Day 1 : The Onward Journey and Karon Beach
Carrying huge amounts of excitement, both of us set forward to catch the evening flight. We had a lay-over at Delhi and reached the Phuket airport the next day morning. It was an hour and half trip from the airport to our place of stay at Oceanview Bungalows by EAT, which was located right next to the Karon beach. We checked-in at the hotel, freshened up and immediately went out to get some lunch. We were clueless where to go and walked straight into a road side hotel and ordered some recommended food. The lunch was actually terrible, as the dish we ordered was some prawn dish which was undercooked and had too much of a raw smell. Half satisfied, we went back to the hotel and had a long nap, catching up some of the lost sleep during the overnight flight journey.

The trip really started for us that evening when we went to the Karon beach. It was a beautiful sunset view, with lots of places to sit and enjoy the evening. We captured some pictures and really felt like photographers. My wife's costume selection was on point as well. We got two of those beds with umbrella and chilled drinking some tender coconuts. We capped of the evening with a stroll along the neighborhood and found a street side shop serving beautiful Pad Thai, the famous Thai dish.

### Day 2 : Buddhist Temples and View Points
After finishing a sumptuous breakfast at the hotel, we rented a cab for the day. Our initial plan was to visit the famous Big Buddha statue, but unfortunately entry was closed for the day. We did however catch a glimse of the status from far away as we were traveling along the road.

We then visted the Wat Chalong, the famous Buddhist temple in Phuket which is said to house a fragment of Buddha's bone. We didn't quite enjoy the visit though as the weather was quite hot and we were sweating crazy. We then traveled to the Karon Beach View Point for some fancy pictures and eye pleasing view of the beach.

We spent the evening much like the previous day, chilling on the Karon beach enjoying the sunset and also having Pad Thai from the same street side hotel as before. We also experienced a couple Thai massage, which was really relaxing. 

### Day 3 : Phi Phi islands & Ferry travel
It was time for us to leave Phuket and travel to our next place of stay in Krabi. Initially, we had considered having a night stay in Phi Phi island, but we felt it would be too much packing and checking-in. So we decided to travel through Phi Phi islands on our way to Krabi. We got a ferry which would allow us to explore the Phi Phi island for 4 hours before taking us to Krabi.

Like yesterday, the weather was quite hot. That however, did not deter us from walking around the entire Phi Phi island. We were roaming along the coast by foot, taking pictures, grabbing some road side food and just enjoying the view. 

We then reached Krabi by another Ferry travel and checked-in at Amorn Mansion. The location was right in the middle of a buzzing road, not very far from the Ao Nang beach shore.

### Day 4 : Island Hopping, Phra Nang Cave & Snorkelling
Easily, the most exhaustive and adventurous day of the trip. We found a package for 4 island trip and decided to give it shot. We were picked up from our hotel in the morning to join the group.

It was like a regular boating trip until they dropped us off in the first island. Though we weren't fully prepared to swim, we couldn't resist getting in the cryster clear water and jumped in. The water was only 1-2 feet deep and we could see the floor clearly. After 20-30 minutes of fun in the water, we snacked at a small shop serving tender coconut and drinks within the island.

We were then taken to a coral location for Snorkelling. However, the guide for some reason strongly recommended us against jumping into the water, citing that the winds were too strong and it was risky to dive in. Out of 20-30 people in the boat, only a UK couple decided to jump off anyway with the Snorkelling gear. Eventually I couldn't resist and jumped in to snorkel. The coral reefs weren't exactly amazing, but I saw some huge fishes swiming nearby almost at touching distance. Turns out, only one more person jumped after me and the remaining people stayed on the boat. 

Finally, we had lunch at a island planned by the organisers and returned to our hotel in the evening. We spent the evening hunting for Pad Thai and Fried rice with Mango.
